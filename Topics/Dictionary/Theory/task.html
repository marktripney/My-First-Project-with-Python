<p>Imagine that you're a birdwatcher sitting in the park and counting birds that you see. You've observed a dozen pigeons, 5 sparrows, and even one red crossbill! Now, suppose that you want to store these observations for later use. You need to remember exactly how many birds of each kind you've seen. So, a simple list with numbers won't do because you won't be able to tell which number refers to which bird. You need a data type that can associate one thing with another: in our case, the name of the bird with the number of observations.</p>
<p>Luckily, Python has such a type — <strong>dictionary</strong> (<code class="language-python">dict</code>). You can picture a real dictionary — a large book with definitions for a lot of words. The definition contains two parts: the word itself (let's call it a <strong>key</strong>) and the definition for it (a <strong>value</strong>). In our birdwatcher example, the keys are names of the birds ("pigeon", "sparrow", and "red crossbill") and the values are how many birds of that kind we've seen (12, 5 and 1, respectively).</p>
<p>In programming, dictionaries work in a similar way: if we want to store an object, we need to select some key for it and put our object as a value for that key into our dictionary.</p>

<p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9008" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. | It is similar to a real dictionary where each word (key) has a definition (value) associated with it. In the context of your birdwatcher example, the keys are the names of the birds, and the values are the number of birds of that kind observed. Dictionaries allow for fast access to objects by selecting a specific key. Python 3.7 and up maintain the insertion order of keys in a dictionary.">A dictionary</a> consists of a collection of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15401" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a key-value pair is a data structure that maps unique keys to associated values in a dictionary. | Each key is used to look up its corresponding value within the dictionary. The key must be immutable and hashable, while the value can be any Python object and can vary in type. Key-value pairs are useful for creating flexible, unordered collections of data where each element has a unique identifier. They are often used in scenarios where fast lookups and efficient storage are important.">key-value pairs</a>. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. If you already know the values needed, then the easiest way to create a dictionary is to use the <strong>curly braces</strong> with a comma-separated list of <code class="language-python">key: value</code> pairs. If you want to create an empty dictionary, you can do so with the help of curly braces as well. Note that values in a dictionary can be of <strong>different types</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">birds = {"pigeon": 12, "sparrow": 5, "red crossbill": 1}
prices = {'espresso': 5.0, 'americano': 8.0, 'latte': 10, 'pastry': 'various prices'}
empty_dict = {}

print(type(birds))  # &lt;class 'dict'&gt;
print(type(prices))  # &lt;class 'dict'&gt;
print(type(empty_dict))  # &lt;class 'dict'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Another way to create a dictionary is to use the <code class="language-python">dict</code> constructor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">another_empty_dict = dict()  # using the dict constructor

print(type(another_empty_dict))  # &lt;class 'dict'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When creating a non-empty dictionary, a dict constructor can take a dictionary as an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an argument is a value that is passed into a function when it is called. | It is used to provide data to the function so that it can perform its intended task. Arguments can be passed either positionally or by keyword, and they can be required or optional. When defining a function, you can specify default values for optional arguments, which allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept. In the context of files, the argument is used to specify where the function will write the given object to. By default, it is set to the standard output stream that prints the object on the screen. However, you can specify a file parameter with the name of the required file, which should be opened in advance and closed when you are done.">argument</a>, and / or future <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9439" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a dictionary key is a unique identifier used to access the corresponding value in a dictionary. | It is similar to the role of a word in a real dictionary, which serves as a lookup key to its definition. In the context of the provided text, the keys are the names of the birds, such as pigeon, sparrow, and red crossbill, and the values are the number of observations, such as 12, 5, and 1. In Python, dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, and keys and values are separated by a colon.">dictionary keys</a> as arguments with assigned values, as in the example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># note that the future dictionary keys are listed without quotes
prices_with_constr = dict({'espresso': 5.0}, americano=8.0, latte=10, pastry='various prices')

print(prices_with_constr)  # {'espresso': 5.0, 'americano': 8.0, 'latte': 10, 'pastry': 'various prices'}</code></pre>
<p>When we give the dict constructor dictionary keys with assigned values, as <code class="language-python">dict(americano=8.0)</code>, the left part of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15664" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an expression is a valid construct in the language that can be evaluated to a value. | This can include a wide range of elements, such as strings in parentheses, object types, mathematical expressions, and even function calls. Expressions are used in function annotations, where they can follow a parameter and provide information about the type or expected value of that parameter.">expression</a> is treated as a variable. In contrast to the use of curly braces, in which you can use integers as keys, keys in the dict constructor can't be an integer, a string in quotes, a list, a multiword expression, etc. That is, the following lines will give you an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">d1 = dict(888=8.0)
d2 = dict("americano"=8.0)
d3 = dict(["americano", "filter"]=8.0)
d4 = dict(the best americano=8.0)</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, the curly braces and the dict constructor are interchangeable, just mind the feature given above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, you can create a nested dictionary. It's a collection of dictionaries <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12623" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a inside refers to the concept of a variable or name being defined within a nested structure, such as a function or a loop. | When the interpreter encounters a name, it first looks for a local definition of that name within the innermost nested structure.

In the context of the provided explanation, the interpreter first looks for the name a within the function, and if it doesn't find one, it then moves outward and looks for a definition of a in the enclosing namespace.">inside</a> one single dictionary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># a nested dictionary example
my_pets = {'dog': {'name': 'Dolly', 'breed': 'collie'},
           'cat': {'name': 'Fluffy', 'breed': 'maine coon'}}

# another nested dictionary example
# note that keys of the outer dictionary are numbers
digits = {1: {'Word': 'one', 'Roman': 'I'}, 
          2: {'Word': 'two', 'Roman': 'II'}, 
          3: {'Word': 'three', 'Roman': 'III'},

<h5 id="accessing-the-items">Accessing the items</h5>
<p>The syntax for <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13907" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, accessing refers to the process of reading or modifying the elements of a sequence, such as a list or a string, by specifying their index or position. | The index is enclosed in square brackets immediately after the sequence name. The index of the first element is 0, and it increases by 1 for each subsequent element. When accessing a list, you can change the value of an element by assigning a new value to its index. However, strings are immutable, which means that you cannot change an individual character; instead, you would need to create a new string with the desired changes.">accessing</a></strong> an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9008" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an item in the context of a dictionary refers to a pairing of a key and a value. | A dictionary is a collection of items, where each item is a key-value pair. The key is used to access the value, and the value can be any object in Python. When accessing a dictionary, you can retrieve, modify, or delete the value associated with a specific key. The item can be added to the dictionary during creation or with the dictionary method update().">item</a> is quite simple — dictionary name followed by a key in square brackets <code class="language-python">[]</code>. This approach works both for adding objects to a dictionary and for reading them from there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_pet = {}

# add 3 keys and their values into the dictionary
my_pet['name'] = 'Dolly'
my_pet['animal'] = 'dog'
my_pet['breed'] = 'collie'

print(my_pet)  # {'name': 'Dolly', 'animal': 'dog', 'breed': 'collie'}

# get information from the dictionary about an added item
print(my_pet['name'])  # Dolly</code></pre>
<p>When working with a nested dictionary, getting the right value may be a little harder. As in our example, there are different levels and you need to stop at the right depth.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># our nested dictionary once again:
my_pets = {'dog': {'name': 'Dolly', 'breed': 'collie'},
           'cat': {'name': 'Fluffy', 'breed': 'maine coon'}}

print(my_pets['cat']['breed'])  # maine coon</code></pre>
<h5 id="choosing-the-keys">Choosing the keys</h5>
<p>You can save objects of any type in a dictionary, but not all of them qualify as a key. You need a good, <strong>unique</strong> key for each object in your collection. Still, this is not the only restriction on dictionary keys and we will cover them later. For now, safely use numbers and strings.</p>
<p>If a key has already been added to your dictionary, its old value will be overwritten:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">trilogy = {'IV': 'Star Wars', 'V': 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'VI': 'Return of the Jedi'}
print(trilogy['IV'])  # Star Wars

trilogy['IV'] = 'A New Hope'
print(trilogy['IV'])  # A New Hope</code></pre>
<p>In <strong>Python 3.7 and up</strong>, dictionaries do maintain the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15705" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, insertion order refers to the position in which an element is placed in a list when it is added. | Prior to Python 3.7, the order in which elements were inserted into a list was not guaranteed to be preserved. However, as of Python 3.7, the order of elements in a list is maintained as the order in which they were inserted. This is important because some algorithms, such as the insertion sort algorithm, rely on the order of elements in a list. When adding an element to a list, the `insert()` method is used, which takes an index as its first argument, indicating the position before which the new element will be inserted.">insertion order</a></strong> for values they store, but in previous versions it is not necessarily so:</p>
