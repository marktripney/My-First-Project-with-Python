<p>Sometimes you need to explain what particular parts of your code are for. Luckily, Python allows you to fulfill your needs. You can leave special notes called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6440" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a comment is a piece of text added to the code by programmers to provide explanations or additional information about the code's functionality, logic, or purpose. | Comments are non-executable and do not affect the program's behavior during runtime. They are primarily used for improving code readability, maintaining code quality, and assisting other developers in understanding the codebase. Python supports both single-line and multi-line comments. Comment usage is limited to functions, methods, and a few other cases. Comment formatting rules should follow PEP 8 guidelines, such as having one space after a hash mark, and two spaces between the end of the code and the hash mark for inline comments. It is essential to write useful, concise, and up-to-date comments, avoiding bad comment practices like contradicting the code or being unnecessary.">comments</a></strong>. They are especially useful for beginners. Throughout this course, we will often use comments to explain our examples.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-comment">What is a comment?</h5>
<p>Python comments start with a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7823" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a hash is a value that is computed by a hash function for a hashable object. | A hashable object is an immutable object, meaning its state cannot be changed after it is created. The hash value for an object remains constant as long as the object is not modified. Hash values are used to quickly look up objects in data structures like hash tables, which are the underlying implementation for Python dictionaries and sets. It is important to note that equal objects must have the same hash value, but unequal objects may also have the same hash value.">hash</a></strong>,<strong> #</strong>. Everything after the hash up to the end of the line is regarded as a comment and will be <strong>ignored </strong>when running the code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("This will run.")  # This won't run</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, you can see what PEP 8 calls an<strong> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5879" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an inline refers to a comment written on the same line as the code. | It provides additional context or explanation for the code. Inline comments should have one space after the hash mark (#) and two spaces between the end of the code and the hash mark. According to PEP 8, the comment length should be limited to 72 characters, and it can be split into several lines to form a block. It is a good practice to indent the comment to the same level as the statement it explains.">inline</a> </strong>comment.<strong> </strong>It's a comment written on the same line as the code.</p>
<p>A comment can also refer to the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a block of code refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Proper indentation is crucial for the block of code to work correctly. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> that follows it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Outputs three numbers
print("1")
print("2")
print("3")</code></pre>
<p>We intend to use comments primarily for learning purposes. Now, it's time to find out how to comment code properly.</p>
<h5 id="formatting-comments">Formatting comments</h5>
<p>Although it is easy to write a comment, let's discuss how to do so according to the best practices.</p>
<p>To begin with, there should be <strong>one space</strong> after a hash mark. For inline comments, there should be <strong>two spaces</strong> between the end of the code and the hash sign. Putting more than two spaces between the end of the code and the hash mark is acceptable, but most commonly, there are exactly two spaces.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("Learning Python is fun!")  # This is proper comment formatting
print("PEP-8 is important!")#This is a very bad example</code></pre>
<p>Indent your comment to the same level as the statement it explains. E.g., the following example is wrong:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    # this comment is in the wrong place
print("This is a statement to print.")</code></pre>
<p>A comment is not a Python command: it should not be too long. Following PEP-8, the comment length should be limited to 72 characters. It's better to split a long comment into several lines. You can do so by adding a hash mark at the beginning of each new line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Imagine this is an example of a very long comment that
# we need to spread over three lines, so we continue to
# write it even here.
print("The long comment above explains this line of code.")</code></pre>
<p>Comments that span multiple lines are called <strong>multi-line</strong> or <strong>block</strong> comments. In Python, there is no special way to indicate them.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>You may come across multi-line comments enclosed in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a triple quote is a set of three quotes (either single or double) used to denote a multi-line string. | Unlike a single or double quote, which are used for single-line strings, triple quotes allow for the creation of strings that span multiple lines. They are often used for documentation strings (docstrings) in Python, which provide a brief description of a module, function, or class. Triple quotes can be placed on separate lines, with the detailed description starting at the same position as the first quote of the first docstring line.">triple quotes</a>: <code class="language-python">"""..."""</code>. Nonetheless, we recommend that you use several lines starting with hash marks for this purpose. Then, your code will comply with the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#block-comments" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official style guide</a>. Triple quotes are reserved for <strong>documentation strings</strong>, <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11869" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a docstring is a string literal that provides documentation for a class, module, or function. | It is written as the first statement in the definition of a module, class, method, or function, and briefly describes its behavior and how to use it, including what parameters to pass to the function. Docstrings can be written in single or double quotes, but triple quotes are often used for multi-line docstrings. There are several Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) dedicated to docstrings, including PEP 257 and PEP 287, which outline conventions for writing docstrings.">docstrings</a> </strong>for short. They are also informative, but their use is limited to functions, methods and several other cases.</p></div>
