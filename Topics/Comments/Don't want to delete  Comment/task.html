<p>Sometimes, it is helpful to comment out parts of a program that you don't need now but want to save for later. Look at the following code and decide what lines to comment out so that when you run this block, only<em> </em>the command that prints <code class="java">7</code> as a result is executed.</p>

<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>You should comment out the lines of code that will NOT print the number <code class="java">7</code>.</p>
